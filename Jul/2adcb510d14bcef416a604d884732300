TEN brightly coloured doghouses arrived in Oudts­hoorn from Cape Town on Saturday. These doghouses were donated by the DogBox Project and Winter Blanket Drive in Cape Town. This initiative invites students to paint the doghouses in bright colours. With every doghouse a bag of dog food and a blanket was also donated. It is the fourth year that the Animal Care Team (ACT) has benefited from the project. “The kennels are given to owners of animals that have been sterilised by our sterilisation drive,” says Vanessa Engelbrecht, chairman of ACT SA in Oudtshoorn. The doghouses will be distributed in the community next week.
