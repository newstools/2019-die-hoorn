THE Animal Care Team SA (ACT) is planning an outreach to a farming district for Mandela Day (Thursday, 18 July) and want residents of the Klein Karoo to get involved in this project. Anyone can get involved by donating soup, bread, clothes, dog or cat food or blankets. Contact Vanessa Engelbrecht (082 927 7276) and help ACT to make a difference in the lives of people and their animals. Donations can be dropped at the Sign Shop in Church Street, Oudtshoorn or at the Cango Vet in Langenhoven Road, Oudtshoorn.
