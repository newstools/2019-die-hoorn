THE Western Cape Minister of Agriculture, Dr Ivan Meyer, recently hosted an awards evening for staff of the Western Cape Provincial Veterinary Laboratory to celebrate their contributions to the laboratory’s success in achieving and maintaining SANAS accreditation in accordance with ISO/IEC17025 standards. This puts the services offered by the laboratory on par with any similar institution in the world. SANAS (The South African National Accreditation System) is the only body responsible for carrying out accreditations in respect of conformity assessment as mandated through the Accreditation for Conformity Assessment, Calibration and Good Laboratory Practice Act (Act 19 of 2006). The Provincial Veterinary Lab was the first ve­terinary lab in the country to attain SANAS accreditation as an ISO 17052 compliant laboratory. This has ensured international acceptance of lab results.
Commenting on the achievement Meyer said: “We should be extremely proud of the work being done by our provincial laboratory. Their work is also linked to our goal to access greater export markets, and therefore the growth of our agricultural economy.” Ten veterinary technologists are currently approved as technical signatories for the accredited test methods in scopes of testing which include Serology for Brucellosis, Avian influenza, Newcastle Disease and African Horse Sickness. “Accreditation for a rapid test for African Horse Sickness means that test results are quicker and cheaper to obtain which will help with the growth of our province’s equine industry,” said Meyer.
