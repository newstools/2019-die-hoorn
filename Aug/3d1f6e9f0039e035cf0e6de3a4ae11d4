According to Capt Philani Nkwalase,  spokesperson for the Hawks, it is alleged that Dorothy, who worked as a teacher and a manager at different learning centres around Oudtshoorn between January 2010 and May 2013,  registered ghost learners, thereby inflating the actual numbers of registered students in order to gain financial benefits from the Western Cape Education Department (WCED). The WCED allegedly lost R946 538 from her illegal activities. The case against Dorothy was postponed to the 6 September 2019 for a Regional Court date, She was released on R2 500 bail.
