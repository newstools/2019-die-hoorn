THE history of the Cango Valley and the influence of the area’s archeology on climate change are some of the interesting topics that will be explored during an outing to the valley arranged by the Simon van der Stel Foundation and the Prince Albert Cultural Foundation. The excursion to the Cango Valley will take place on Saturday 25 May and includes visits to the historic Boomplaats and the adjacent Boomplaas cave, one of the few deeply stratified archaeological sites in the Southern Cape, with evidence extending into the deep past. Rosie Schoeman (néé Botha) will talk about the Botha family of the original Boomplaats (1810) while Dr Judy Maquire, a palaeontologist, will discuss climate change from an archeological perspective.
The day kicks off at 10:00 at the Cango Caves. Other places of interest that will be visited, are Grootkraal, a short section of the original Swartberg Pass/Schoemanspoort pass as well as a Schoemanshoek double-deep homestead of around 1880 and the old Spies tobacco factory on the old Caves Road. The visit includes lunch (soup and bread at Berluda Guest House) and joint transport can be arranged if you book as soon as possible. • All welcome!
