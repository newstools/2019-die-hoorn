A PHOTO exhibition and competition will this year form part of a World Aids Day awareness campaign in Oudts­hoorn, organised by the local SANDF’s Health Centre South Coast (HCSC). Participants have to enter two photos illustrating the following: • A photo representing what you have become aware of during a meaningful conversation with someone about how, as South Africans, we are all affected in some way by HIV/Aids.
It could be sharing your own story or thoughts with someone you trust, or finding someone who would like to share their story or thoughts on the issue. • A second photo representing your highest hope for HIV/Aids in the future.
Each photo has to be accompanied with a short description explaining the meaning behind the photo.
Written permission is needed if the photo includes people. Entries close on 22 November 2019. Photos will be exhibited in public libraries in and around Oudtshoorn, with an official opening at the Health Centre South Coast Reception in Oudtshoorn. E-mail entries to hvdveen1966@gmail.com.
