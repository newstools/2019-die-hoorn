THE World Aids Day Colour Fun Run and Quiz will take place on 6 December in Oudtshoorn, the second time after a very succesful first fun run last year. Residents are encouraged to take part in huge numbers for this fun event which is organised by the SANDF’s Health Centre South Coast (HCSC). The start of the 5 km route is in front of the NA Smit Swimming Pool in Park Road, down Van der Riet Street, then right into Baron van Reede Street, right into Voortrekker Road, right into Jan van Riebeek Road, left into North Street and finally back into Park Road, before fi-nishing at the swimming pool again. Six team members may enter for the team competition at a cost of R50 per team, with individual entries available at R20 per person. There are also more to this fun run than just running! Teams will have to answer a question at each of five water points on the course, and at the end be scored on their finishing position and number of correct answers. • Pre-entries close on 4 December at 12:00 and late entries at 08:30 on the day of the race.
Entries (cash payments only) at Venecia Oktober at HCSC reception in Park Road (044 203 4227).
