THE Calitzdorp Vetplantfees will be back on 21 and 22 September! The Vetplantfees (Succulent Festival) is an annual festival hosted by the Calitzdorp Succulent Society to showcase many of South Africa’s beautiful and rare succulents together with succulents from all over the world. Calitzdorp is situated in the Klein Karoo, a region where many of the succulents endemic to South Africa can be seen in their natural environment. Succulent enthusiasts who visit Calitzdorp during the festival will be able to immerse themselves in a range of activities to discover the world of succulents – you will see indigenous and rare succulents in their natural habitat, buy specimens not available in nurseries and get advice on how to propagate, grow and care for succulents in the garden. The festival will include:
• Veld walks led by local guides; • A potted plant market hosted by growers; • Educational talks by succulent experts; • “How To” workshops; • Original plant pots for sale; • A succulent plant exhibition; • A botanical art exhibition; • Botanical art sold by artists; • A rare plant auction; • Activities for children; • Keynote dinner featuring the world movie premiere of Survival of the Fattest. Entrance to the festival is free. Information about the festival will be made available on the website of the Calitzdorp Succulent Society at www. vetplant.co.za. • The Succulent Society tries to assist with the conservation and preservation of succulents from the Klein Karoo through public education and promotion.
